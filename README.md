# FACE MASK DETECTION 

Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. The absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task cumbersome and challenging.

Face Mask Detection System built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in 
real-time video streams. All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file requirements.txt. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
